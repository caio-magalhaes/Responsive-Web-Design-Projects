## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

This project was a good way to practice Semantic HTML5 concepts. And the first project i developed in this Responsive Web Design repository.

### Continued development

I want to keep my Semantic HTML skills sharp in my future projects improving the SEO of the pages i develop.

### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) - This helped me review the main functionalities of the HTML so i could build semantic pages. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
